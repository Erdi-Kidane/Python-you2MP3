Coverts youtube URLs into mp3 songs from the text file songList.txt
format must be:
URL NAME
where URL = some youtube video
where NAME = name of the song

Some kinks to work out for later:
*need to validate input better
*limit on the number of possible processes spawned maybe? (more research into parallel programming in python needed)
